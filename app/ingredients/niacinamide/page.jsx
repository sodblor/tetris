            <p>
              Niacinamide is a versatile, well-researched skincare ingredient that supports a healthy-looking barrier,
              more even tone, and smoother texture. It is generally gentle and works well for many skin types, including
              oily, acne-prone, and sensitive skin when used at suitable concentrations.

              <li>Start with 2–5% niacinamide if you are new or sensitive.</li>

              <li>
                Always pair your routine with sunscreen in the morning, especially when targeting dark spots or uneven

              <li>
                If you notice redness or discomfort, reduce how often you use it or switch to a lower concentration and
                simplify the rest of your routine.
              </li>
              <li>Patch test any new niacinamide product on a small area before applying it to your whole face.</li>
