          What Makes Dr. Althea Stand Out in K-Beauty
        </h1>

        <div className="space-y-6 leading-relaxed text-[15px] sm:text-base text-muted-foreground">
          <p>
            Dr. Althea has carved out a special place in Korean skincare by focusing on gentle yet effective formulas.
            Instead of relying on heavy fragrances or harsh alcohols, the brand centers its routines around barrier-
            friendly ingredients that suit sensitive, acne-prone, and reactive skin types.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-serif text-xl sm:text-2xl text-foreground mt-8">Clean, Dermatologist-Inspired Formulas</h2>
          <p>
            The brand is known for creating products that feel like a balance between clinical care and everyday
            comfort. Many formulas are designed to be minimalist, layerable, and compatible with other skincare, so you
            can build a routine without worrying about irritation or product conflicts.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-serif text-xl sm:text-2xl text-foreground mt-8">Hero Ingredients You See Again and Again</h2>
          <p>
            Across the line, you&apos;ll often find barrier-supporting and soothing ingredients such as ceramides,
            centella asiatica (cica), hyaluronic acid, and niacinamide. Together, they help:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Strengthen and replenish a weakened skin barrier</li>
            <li>Calm visible redness and irritation</li>
            <li>Deliver long-lasting hydration without heaviness</li>
            <li>Support a smoother, more even-looking complexion</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="font-serif text-xl sm:text-2xl text-foreground mt-8">Designed for Sensitive &amp; Reactive Skin</h2>
          <p>
            Because so many Dr. Althea products are built around calming, non-stripping formulas, they appeal to people
            whose skin struggles with typical actives. Rather than chasing quick, dramatic results, the brand leans
            into slow-and-steady improvements that prioritize comfort, hydration, and barrier repair.
          </p>

          <p>
            For anyone exploring K-beauty but nervous about irritation, Dr. Althea offers a soft, reassuring entry
            point backed by thoughtful ingredient choices.
