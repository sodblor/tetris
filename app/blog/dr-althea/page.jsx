          All About Dr. Althea: Gentle Korean Skincare for Healthy, Glowing Skin

          <p>
            Dr. Althea is a Korean skincare brand known for blending science and natural ingredients to create products
            that soothe, hydrate, and repair the skin. The brand focuses especially on formulas that work well for
            sensitive, acne-prone, and barrier-compromised skin, making it a popular choice for those looking for
            effective yet gentle solutions.

          <h2 className="font-serif text-xl sm:text-2xl text-foreground mt-8">🌿 What Makes Dr. Althea Stand Out</h2>
          <p>
            Dr. Althea emphasizes clean, dermatologist-inspired formulations that avoid harsh additives like strong
            fragrances and irritating alcohols. Instead, their products often include ceramides, centella asiatica,
            hyaluronic acid, and niacinamide to strengthen the skin barrier, calm inflammation, and deliver long-lasting
            hydration.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-serif text-xl sm:text-2xl text-foreground mt-8">🌟 Best-Known Products</h2>
          <h3 className="font-semibold text-foreground mt-4">345 Relief Cream</h3>
          <p>
            One of the brand’s best-selling products, this cream is celebrated for helping soothe irritated skin,
            reinforce the skin barrier, and deliver a comforting layer of hydration. Many reviewers highlight its light,
            non-greasy feel and barrier-supporting formulation with ceramides and niacinamide — though individual
            results may vary depending on skin type.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-semibold text-foreground mt-4">Vitamin C Boosting Serum</h3>
          <p>
            This brightening serum has also gained attention for helping fade dark spots and improve overall radiance.
            It combines vitamin C with supportive ingredients that are generally gentle on sensitive skin — making it
            suitable for those who want a glow without irritation.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-semibold text-foreground mt-4">Amino Acid Cleanser &amp; Other Care Products</h3>
          <p>
            Dr. Althea’s cleansing and hydration products, such as their amino acid gel cleanser and soothing essence,
            round out full skincare routines that aim for a balanced, healthy complexion with minimal irritation.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-serif text-xl sm:text-2xl text-foreground mt-8">🧪 Real User Impressions</h2>
          <p>
            Across review platforms, many users praise Dr. Althea products for being gentle, hydrating, and easy to
            layer with other skincare items. Some users with combination or sensitive skin report improved hydration and
            barrier function, while a few note that more occlusive products may feel a bit heavy for very oily skin.
            Skin reactions are always personal, so patch testing first is recommended.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-serif text-xl sm:text-2xl text-foreground mt-8">🧴 Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            Dr. Althea has successfully positioned itself as a K-beauty brand that meets the needs of everyday skincare
            lovers — especially those who want effective yet calm formulas. Whether you’re aiming for barrier repair,
            hydration, or brighter skin tone, the brand offers accessible options rooted in tried-and-tested
            ingredients.
